# abalone-regression-study

## Dataset
The abalone dataset used in this project was downloaded from `http://mlr.cs.umass.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone > Data Folder > abalone.data` on April 17, 2020. It can be found locally as `path-to-repository/abalone_data.csv` (e.g. `Desktop/abalone-regression-study/abalone_data.csv`). `path-to-repository/abalone_data.csv` contains the same, unaltered data as when downloaded.

## Dependencies
To locally run this study, you will need the following installed.

* Python 2.7
* numpy library
* pandas library
* scikit-learn library
* math library

## How to Run
1. Download this repository to your preferred directory (e.g. `Desktop`)
2. Open `path-to-repository/abalone_regression.py` (e.g. `Desktop/abalone-regression-study/abalone_regression.py`)
3. Change `regType = "lr` to desired algorithm (Choices: `lr` for Linear Regression, `krr` for Kernel Ridge Regression, `knr` for k-Neighbors Regression, and `nn` for a Neural Network)
4. Go to your preferred directory on your command line (e.g. `cd ~/Desktop/abalone-regression-study`)
5. Run `python abalone_regression.py` to generate CSVs and print scores and statistics
6. CSVs generated by your run will appear as `path-to-repository/krr_i.csv`, `path-to-repository/knr_i.csv`, and/or `path-to-repository/nn_i.csv`, where "i" corresponds to the nested cross-validation outer-loop fold number. Note: Linear Regression will only print a single score and will not generate CSVs.

## Results
The analysis is located in `path-to-repository/report.pdf` (e.g. `Desktop/abalone-regression-study/report.pdf`).

CSVs generated from my run are located in `path-to-repository/results/raw/` (e.g. `Desktop/abalone-regression-study/results/raw/`). Tables found in the analysis were trimmed from abridged copies of the CSVs located in `path-to-repository/results/report_analysis/` (e.g. `Desktop/abalone-regression-study/results/report_analysis/`). Screenshots of printed scores and statistics are also located in `path-to-repository/results/report_analysis/`.
